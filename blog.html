          1. What is the difference between local storage and session storage?
        </summary>
        <p>
          The difference between session storage and local storage is that local
          storage data does not expire, whereas session storage data is cleared
          when the page session ends. A unique page session gets created once a
          document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only
          one tab at a time.

          2. What is difference between global scope and block scope?
        </summary>
        <p>
          Global Scope : Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have
          Global Scope. Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a
          JavaScript program. Variables declared with var, let and const are
          quite similar when declared outside a block. They all have Global
          Scope.
          <br />
          <br />
          Block Scope : Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and
          Function Scope. ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords:
          let and const. These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.
          Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside
          the block.

        <summary>3. How does the Event Loop works in JavaScript?</summary>
        <p>
          The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the
          Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take
          the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack,
          which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the
          Event Loop.

        <summary>4. How many types can we get undefined?</summary>
        <ol>
          <li>Variable that is not initialized will give undefined</li>
          <li>Function with no return will give undefined</li>
          <li>Parameter that is not passed will give undefined</li>
          <li>If return has nothing on the right side will return undefined</li>
          <li>Property that doesn't exists on an object will give undefined</li>
          <li>
            Accessing array element outside of the index range will give
            undefined
          </li>
          <li>Deleteing and element inside an array will give undefined</li>
          <li>Set a value directly to undefined</li>
        </ol>
